It's often counterproductive to strive for perfection early on. You simply don't
have enough context on how your codebase needs to (or doesn't need to) evolve to
support some yet-to-be-determined feature. Instead, focus on getting the
requirements right for the present, and **let your code rot** a little before
letting in the temptation to refactor.

The classic example is trying to write generic code that can handle what is
currently known, whilst remaining flexible enough to tackle any future
requirement too.
