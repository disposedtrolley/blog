Thanks for stopping by! You've reached the homepage and blog of a software
engineer living in Melbourne, Australia, who's particularly interested in
backend web development, distributed systems, and embedded microcontrollers.

You can find this person [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/disposedtrolley)
(although don't expect much activity), or in person at
[Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com/) where he's helping to build out the future
of API development.
