      <description>There&#39;s a salad place I like called Chia Chia near where I&#39;m currently working. I like it for the same reasons I hate it; it epitomises my fear of choice. How so? Here&#39;s their salad &amp;ldquo;menu&amp;rdquo;:
Scary isn&#39;t it? There are 100 possible combinations of bases alone! Maybe trying out all of the salads here will make it into the bucket list. It&#39;ll certainly be quite a gastronomical achievement.
Of course, there are &amp;ldquo;better&amp;rdquo; things for a bucket list and trying every possible combination of ingredients would likely produce more than a few inedible salads.</description>
